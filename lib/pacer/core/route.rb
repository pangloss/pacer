Pacer's routes are a very efficient and fast way to deal with data.

The fundamental thing about them is that they are lazily evaluated, which
allows very expensive traversals to be defined, yet nearly always produces
results immediately with very low memory requirements, too.

Various graphs are supported in their own Rubygems. Check out pacer-neo4j,
pacer-orient, pacer-dex for now. New graphs emerge frequently and I hope to
support many of them.

Search rubygems.org or github for projects that start with "pacer-" to see what

How to use Pacer's inline help:

You can use Pacer.help(:section) to print help on general topics, or get
context-specific help by calling help on any route. For example:

    graph.v.out_e.map.help  # will give you help about the map command.

#{general_topics}

General options (may not be available for all methods)

  element_type: Symbol  Set what type of element is emitted from this step.
      registered types: #{ Pacer::RouteBuilder.current.element_types.keys.map(&:inspect).join ', ' }

  graph: PacerGraph     If the route contains graph elements, specify that they
                        are from this graph

  route_name: String    Name for this route when inspecting it in IRB.

  info: String          Put what you want here. Appears when the route is inspected.

  extensions: [Module]  Extra extensions to add to the route.

  wrapper: Class         Wrap elements in this class.
